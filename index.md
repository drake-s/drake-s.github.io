My name is Drake Sitaraman and welcome to my personal web page!

I graduated with a B.S. in Systems Engineering (with Honors) in May 2020
and a B.S. in Computer Science in August 2021, both from the University of Arizona.

I was the team leader for my Engineering senior capstone project. I led
my team in this two semester-long project to create a medical imaging software.
We won an award for Best Implementation for Agile Methodology out of all
senior design teams.
